Inheritance:
-> Characteristics of parent are inherited by child

Template Inheritance:
-> When we have multiple templates about.html, index.html, feeback.html 
which may have multiple common characteristics like navbar, footer, etc..
then we use a rule DRY principle in such cases we create a parent template having the common 
characteristics.

-> To inherit template, use the extends tag

-> Parent template is called base.html

-> For overriding specific parts of a template use the block tag

-> {% extends %} must be the first template tag

-> If we need to get the content of the block from the parent template, 
the {{block.super}} variable will do the trick
