SDP -> Web & App


Important part of SDP is the request -> response model

Types of request:
1. Get
2. Post
3. Update
4. Delete

Creating a website or software with these 4 operations is called CRUD project (Create(Post)  Read(Get) Update  Delete)


The request is done in a server or database


Response from server is called backend and the request is send from frontend


Django is a framework for backend
